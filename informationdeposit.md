4.11 For conventional ILDs, the eDPR forms are to be submitted according to the type of
underlying reference or type of combination of underlying references and the

underlying reference or same type of combination of underlying references and that

reference to the price of commodity, and are offered in RM, then only one eDPR form

member will have to submit a new eDPR form in respect of that group of ILDs.
```
```
