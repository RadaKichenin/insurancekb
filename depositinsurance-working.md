SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
```
**Background**
1.1 The Guidelines on Provision of Information on Deposit Insurance (“Guidelines”) are
issued pursuant to section 209 of the Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation Act
2011 (“PIDM Act”).

1.2 These Guidelines govern disclosures by the deposit-taking members (“DTMs”) about
membership status and deposit insurance provided by Perbadanan Insurans Deposit
Malaysia (“PIDM”).^1 These Guidelines aim to ensure that customers receive accurate,
relevant, consistent and timely information regarding deposit insurance protection.
This is to facilitate informed decision-making by the customers on the placement of
their monies in deposits offered by the DTMs.

1.3 To achieve this, PIDM requires a DTM, in a manner specified in these Guidelines, to –

```
(a) represent itself as a member of PIDM;
(b) provide customers with relevant deposit insurance information; and
(c) disclose to customers whether a deposit offered by it is protected by PIDM.
```
1.4 Further, these Guidelines include illustrations to facilitate consistent implementation
by the DTMs. Any example given in these Guidelines is meant as illustration of the
disclosure requirements and not intended as the only information that needs to be
disclosed to the customers.

1.5 These Guidelines shall be read together with:

```
(a) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Provision of Information on Deposit
Insurance) Regulations 2011;
(b) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Provision of Information on Deposit
Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (“Regulations 2019”);
(c) Guidelines on Submission of Deposit Product Information;
(d) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Disclosure Requirements for Trust
Accounts and Joint Accounts) Regulations 2012;
```
(^1) It is an international recommendation that banks which directly interface with depositors should be required
to provide information to depositors about deposit insurance.


```

```
(e) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Disclosure Requirements for Trust
Accounts and Joint Accounts) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 that comes into

(f) Guidelines on Deposit Insurance Coverage for Deposits.
```
```
The Regulations set out in paragraphs 1.5(d) and 1.5(e) shall collectively be referred
to as “Joint and Trust Regulations 2022”.
```
1.6 These Guidelines shall supersede the Guidelines on Provision of Information on
Deposit Insurance issued on 30 March 2020.

1.7 A summary of key changes from the superseded Guidelines issued prior to 18 May
2022 is set out in Appendix 1 for ease of reference.

1.8 Unless expressly stated otherwise, any information or document required to be
submitted to PIDM under these Guidelines including any letter, report, action plan,
shall be submitted online through the PIDM’s Portal. The original hard copy shall be
kept by the DTMs.

1.9 A reference to a statute or other law includes regulations and other instruments under
it and consolidations, amendments, re-enactments or replacements of any of them.

1.10 PIDM may specify such other periods or dates for compliance with any of the
provisions in these Guidelines, or for any act to be done, in such form and subject to
such terms and conditions as PIDM thinks fit.
