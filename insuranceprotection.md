###### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

**Background**
1.1 The Guidelines on Provision of Information on Takaful and Insurance Benefits
Protection (“Guidelines”) are issued pursuant to section 209 of the Malaysia Deposit
Insurance Corporation Act 2011 (“PIDM Act”).

1.2 These Guidelines govern disclosures by the insurer members (“IMs”) about their
membership status and the protection provided by Perbadanan Insurans Deposit
Malaysia (“PIDM”) under its Takaful and Insurance Benefits Protection System
(“TIPS”). These Guidelines aim to ensure that customers receive accurate, relevant,
consistent and timely information from the IMs regarding TIPS protection. Such
information will facilitate an informed decision-making by the customers before they
buy takaful or insurance products. This is also important in enhancing consumer
confidence.

1.3 To achieve this, PIDM requires an IM, in a manner specified in these Guidelines, to –

```
(a) represent itself as a member of PIDM;
(b) provide customers with relevant TIPS protection information; and
(c) disclose to customers whether takaful or insurance benefits under its takaful
or insurance products are protected by PIDM.
```
1.4 Further, these Guidelines include illustrations to facilitate consistent implementation
by the IMs. Any example given in these Guidelines is meant as illustration of the
disclosure requirements only and shall not be taken as the only information that is
required to be disclosed to the customers.

1.5 These Guidelines shall be read together with:

```
(a) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Provision of Information on Takaful
and Insurance Benefits Protection) Regulations 2022 ;
(b) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Protected Benefits) Regulations 2020;
and
(c) Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Protected Benefits Limit) Order 2020.
```

```
TITLE GUIDELINES ON PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON TAKAFUL AND INSURANCE BENEFITS PROTECTION
```
**Effective date**
1.6 IMs are required to comply with these Guidelines effective from 1 June 2024
(“effective date”). Early adoption of these Guidelines is highly encouraged.

1.7 With the issuance of these Guidelines, the Guidelines for Insurer Members on the Use
of PIDM’s Protection and Membership Representation in Advertisements issued on 29
February 2012 (“2012 Guidelines”) are deemed superseded with immediate effect.^1

1.8 Unless expressly stated otherwise, any information or document required to be
submitted to PIDM under these Guidelines including any letter, report, action plan,
shall be submitted online through the PIDM’s Portal. The original hard copy shall be
kept by the IMs.

1.9 A reference to a statute or other law includes regulations and other instruments under
it and consolidations, amendments, re-enactments or replacements of any of them.

1.10 PIDM may specify such other periods or dates for compliance with any of the
provisions in these Guidelines, or for any act to be done, in such form and subject to
such terms and conditions as PIDM thinks fit.

1.11 All enquiries related to these Guidelines may be directed to:

```

Telephone : 03 2265 6418 / 03 2173 7561
Email : policytips@pidm.gov.my

```

```
(^1) The requirements in the 2012 Guidelines are of voluntary adoption. For the avoidance of doubt, during the
transitional period until 1 June 2024, an IM is allowed to retain the membership representation and the
statements prescribed in the 2012 Guidelines in its issued or existing supplies of advertisement.

```

regarding TIPS protection to its customers, with respect to –

```
(a) its status as a member of PIDM; and
(b) what constitutes, or does not constitute, a protected benefit.
```
4.3 An IM shall ensure that the location at which, and the manner in which, such
representations are displayed do not give false or misleading impressions to
customers that –

```
(a) a person is a member institution when it is not a member institution; and
(b) the benefits in its takaful certificates or insurance policies are protected by
PIDM when it is not eligible to be protected by PIDM.
```
4.4 An IM shall draw the customer’s attention to the relevant information relating to the
TIPS protection to allow the customers to make an informed decision. In ensuring
accuracy in disclosures, an IM may be guided by the TIPS Brochure or any information

necessary references may be provided by the IM to allow the customers to obtain
additional information on TIPS protection.
