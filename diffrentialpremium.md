##### PART 1 : INTRODUCTION

### 1.0 BACKGROUND

1.1 Pursuant to the Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Differential Premium
Systems in respect of Deposit-Taking Members) Regulations 2023,^1 deposit-taking
members (“DTMs”) shall be assessed for premium purposes as follows:

```
(a) under the existing differential premium system (“DPS”) framework for
assessment year (“AY”) 2023 and AY 2024; and
(b) under a revised DPS framework for AY 2025 onwards. The revised DPS
framework consists of two (2) assessment criteria, namely the “safety and
soundness criteria” and the “resolution centric criteria” (“RCC”), to promote an
effective incentive mechanism.
```
1.2 Based on the revised DPS framework, PIDM recognises that DTMs may require time to
implement the new RCC indicators, including to make necessary system and process
enhancement and recalibrate performance expectations. In this regard, PIDM has put
in place a transitional arrangement where DTMs will be required to submit information
pertaining to the RCC indicators (“DPS Transition Period Reporting”) in order to
facilitate DTMs in the implementation of the requirements of the revised DPS
framework. This way, PIDM will also have the opportunity to gather input on the
reporting forms for refinement, if necessary. DTMs will continue to be assessed under
the existing DPS framework for premium charges during the transition period.

1.3 This guidance note is issued as part of the revised DPS framework’s transitional
arrangement to provide details and requirements pertaining to the submission of the
DPS Transition Period Reporting.

### 2.0 TRANSITION PERIOD REPORTING EFFECTIVE DATE

2.1 DTMs are required to submit the DPS Transition Period Reporting for two (2) years i.e.
AY 2023 and AY 2024 (“transition period”).

(^1) Came into force on 21 July 2023.


```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, during the transition period, DTMs are required to submit
information to PIDM as follows:

```
(a) Reporting information required for DPS assessment under the existing
DPS framework as set out in the Guidelines on the Differential Premium
Systems for Deposit Insurance System (issued on 30 March 2020),
which remains effective until the revised DPS framework comes into
force for AY 2025;
(b) DPS Transition Period Reporting required in respect of the revised DPS
framework under the transition period as stipulated in this guidance
note.
```
2.3 DTMs are required to submit the DPS Transition Period Reporting (in pre-formatted
template) by 1 November 2023 (for AY 2023 reporting) and by 30 April 2024 (for AY
2024 reporting), through PIDM’s Industry Portal.

2.4 The diagram below summarised the detailed requirements of the DPS framework from
AY 2023 and AY 2025 onwards:

```

2.5 The RCC indicators are computed at entity level. For clarity, conventional DTMs
carrying Islamic banking businesses are not required to compute the RCC indicators
separately for its conventional and Islamic banking businesses.

## PART 2: REVISED DPS FRAMEWORK

### 3.0 OVERVIEW OF THE REVISED DPS FRAMEWORK

3.1 The revised DPS Framework incorporates two (2) main areas of assessment, namely
the “safety and soundness criteria” and the “resolution centric criteria” which aim to
differentiate the risk profiles of DTMs while providing incentives towards resolvability.
The framework also introduces the linear interpolation method in the RCC assessment
as a mean to improve the fairness and effectiveness of the incentive structure.

3.2 The table below illustrates the overall revised DPS Framework and the premium rate
formula:
**Table 1: Revised DPS Framework

```
Forms the basis for a DTM’s Risk
Grade and the corresponding
Base Premium Rate (“BPR”).
```
```
A measure to differentiate
DTMs by their risk profiles and
management control functions.
```
```
The BPR represents the
maximum premium rate
payable by each DTM
depending on their Risk Grade.
```
```
A higher BPR will apply as a
DTM’s risk profile deteriorates.
```
```

from the BPR.
```
```
Computation for both are as
below: -
```
1. **Total Weighted RCC Score**
    = ∑ RCC indicators’
    weighted average score
2. **RCC Adjustment**
    = Total Weighted RCC
    Score x 50% x BPR

```
Premium Rate
```
```
Premium Rate = BPR - [Total
Weighted RCC Score x 50% x
BPR]
```
```
The Premium Rate is
multiplied by Total Insured
Deposits to determine total
premium payable by each
DTM.
```
### 4.0 ASSESSMENT CRITERIA UNDER THE REVISED DPS FRAMEWORK

```
Safety and Soundness Criteria Assessment
```
4.1 The assessment of the safety and soundness criteria is anchored on BNM’s supervisory
rating as a means to differentiate DTMs by their risk profiles, considering the
comprehensiveness and robustness of BNM’s risk-based supervisory framework.

4.2 The supervisory rating is mapped to a Risk Grade which represents the safety and
soundness criteria assessment. The Risk Grade will accordingly set the basis for a
corresponding Base Premium Rate^2.

(^2) Base premium rate as prescribed in the Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Rates for First Premium and
Annual Premium in Respect of Deposit-Taking Members) Order 2023

High or equivalent 4
```
```
Resolution Centric Criteria Assessment
```
4.3 The quantitative indicators under the RCC assessment, comprising free tangible assets
cover ratio, net impaired assets cover ratio and composition of core funds, serve as
the proxy for measuring loss in the event of failure as they represent some of the
components influencing losses in resolution.

4.4 The three (3) indicators are accorded equal weightage with a weighted rate of one
third (1/3) to arrive at the weighted score for each RCC indicator. The sum of the
weighted scores for all of the indicators shall provide the total weighted RCC score.

#### Indicator 1: Free Tangible Asset Cover (“FTAC”) Ratio

4.5 The FTAC ratio measures the sufficiency of free tangible assets to
meet non-capital related liabilities. The greater the value of a DTM’s free tangible
assets vis-à-vis its liability, the lower the expected losses to be borne by senior
unsecured claimants in resolution.

4.6 The formula to calculate the FTAC ratio is as follows:

```
Free Tangible Assets
Non-Capital Related Liabilities
```
4.7 Free tangible assets is computed as follows:

```
Total Assets – (Goodwill and Other Intangibles + Deferred Tax
Assets + Loans/ Financing Sold to Cagamas + Assets Pledged
for Repurchase Agreement + Assets funded by Investment
Accounts + Other Pledged Assets)
```

```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
```
Notes:
```
```
(a) Goodwill and other intangibles is as deducted under the regulatory
adjustments, as specified in BNM’s Capital Adequacy Framework (Capital
Components) and Capital Adequacy Framework for Islamic Banks (Capital
Components).
```
```
(b) Deferred tax assets is as deducted under the regulatory adjustments, as
specified in BNM’s Capital Adequacy Framework (Capital Components) and
Capital Adequacy Framework for Islamic Banks (Capital Components).
```
```
(c) Loans/financing sold to Cagamas refers to loans/financing sold to Cagamas
Berhad (the National Mortgage Corporation of Malaysia) with recourse.
```
```
(d) Assets pledged for repurchase agreement (“Repo”) refers to Repo Securities
held-in-custody for (i) conventional Repo transactions as per BNM’s
Repurchase Agreement Transactions policy document; and (ii) Islamic repo
transaction such as Sell and Buy Back Agreement (“SBBA”) and Collateralised
Commodity Murabahah (“CCM”).
```
```
(e) Assets funded by investment accounts (“IA”) (on-balance sheet), including
loans/financing, financial assets and/or other assets.
```
```
(f) Other pledged assets refers to all other forms of pledged assets which will not
be available to meet senior unsecured claimants in resolution. For example,
assets pledged (either explicitly or implicitly) to secure, collateralised or credit-
enhance any transaction, including where the asset is designated to support
the DTM’s access to the Restricted Committed Liquidity Facilities (“RCLF”)^3.
```
4.8 Non-Capital Related Liabilities is computed as follows:

```
Total Liabilities – (Recourse Obligations on Loans/Financing Sold
to Cagamas + Repurchase Agreement + Investment Accounts +
Additional Tier 1 & Tier 2 Capital Instruments + Other Secured
Liabilities)
```
(^3) For the avoidance of doubt, assets that have been pre-positioned or deposited with, or pledged to the central
bank (excluding RCLF), a public sector entity or a payment and settlement system, which have not been used
to generate liquidity shall not be treated as pledged assets.


```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
```
Notes:
```
```
(a) Recourse obligations on loans/financing sold to Cagamas refers to outstanding
obligations arising from loans/financing sold to Cagamas Berhad (the National
Mortgage Corporation of Malaysia) with recourse basis.
```
```
(b) Repurchase agreement refers to (i) conventional Repo transactions entered by
DTMs as per BNM’s Repurchase Agreement Transactions policy document; and
(ii) Islamic Repo transaction entered by DTMs such as SBBA and CCM.
```
```
(c) Investment accounts refer to on-balance sheet restricted IA and unrestricted
IA as specified under BNM’s policy document on Investment Account.
```
```
(d) Additional Tier 1^4 (“AT1”) and Tier 2 capital instruments as specified under
BNM’s Capital Adequacy Framework (Capital Components) and Capital
Adequacy Framework for Islamic Banks (Capital Components). DTMs shall
report the outstanding amount (principal and accrued interest) of both capital
instruments.
```
```
(e) Other secured liabilities include all other liabilities that are backed by other
pledged assets in paragraph 4.6 (f).
```
```
A DTM’s FTAC ratio shall be scored based on the following threshold:
```
**Table 3: FTAC Ratio Threshold and Score**

```
Threshold Score
FTAC ratio ≥ 1.3 times 100 %
1 time < FTAC ratio < 1.3 times Interpolated*
FTAC ratio ≤ 1 time 0 %
*The detailed explanation of linear interpolation method is provided under Paragraph 5.
```
(^4) Classified as financial liabilities under applicable Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards.


```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
#### Indicator 2: Net Impaired Asset Cover (“NIAC”) Ratio

4.9 The NIAC ratio measures a DTM’s capital level in excess of minimum regulatory capital
ratio of 8% against potential credit losses arising from impaired assets (including loans
and financing, investment securities and other assets) which reflect the DTM’s credit
risk profile. The ratio provides incentives for strong capital buffers, while promoting
sound credit underwriting standards. A higher NIAC ratio represents better capacity to
absorb losses vis-à-vis a DTM’s credit risk profile.

4.10 The formula to calculate the NIAC ratio is as follows:

```
Total Capital – (Total Risk-Weighted Assets x Regulatory
```
Minimum Total Capital Ratio) (^)
Adjusted Net Impaired Assets
**Notes:**
(a) Total capital is as defined under BNM’s policy document on Capital Adequacy
Framework (Capital Components) and Capital Adequacy Framework for Islamic
Banks (Capital Components). The total capital amount shall be after deducting
proposed dividend, if any. The proposed dividend deducted from total capital
is allowed to be reduced by a portion of dividend to be reinvested by
shareholders under dividend reinvestment plan (“DRP”), subject to meeting
the requirements as stipulated under BNM’s Implementation Guidance on
Capital Adequacy Framework (Capital Components).
(b) Total risk-weighted assets is as defined under BNM’s policy document on
Capital Adequacy Framework (Capital Components) and Capital Adequacy
Framework for Islamic Banks (Capital Components).
(c) Regulatory minimum total capital ratio is defined as 8% for purposes of
computation of the NIAC ratio.
(d) Adjusted net impaired assets refers to the following:
(i) Net impaired assets comprise on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet
impaired assets and are derived as follows:


```

```
```
Table 4: Impaired Assets and Computation of Net Impaired Assets
```
```

*The ECL do not reduce the carrying amount of financial investments at
FVOCI in the statement of financial position which remains at fair value.
```
```
(ii) Net impaired assets computed based on paragraph 4.10(d)(i) shall be
adjusted for IA placements as follows:
```
```
a. Net impaired assets attributed to IA placements shall be included in
the net impaired assets of the DTMs making an IA placement^5 ; and
```
```
b. Net impaired assets funded by IA shall be excluded from the net
impaired assets of the DTMs receiving an IA placement^6. For IA
placements not recognised as an on-balance sheet item, no
adjustment is required.
```
(^5) If the net impaired assets attributed to IA placements has been reflected in the net impaired assets as
described in paragraph 4.10(d)(i), no further adjustment is required.
(^6) IA placement from customer and financial institutions such as restricted IA placements and unrestricted IA
placements.


```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
```
A DTM’s NIAC ratio shall be scored based on the following threshold:
```
```
Table 5 : NIAC Ratio Threshold and Score
Threshold Score
Net impaired asset cover ratio ≥ 3 times 100 %
1 time < Net impaired asset cover ratio
< 3 times Interpolated*^
Net impaired asset cover ratio ≤ 1 time 0 %
*The detailed explanation of linear interpolation method is provided under Paragraph 5.
```
#### Indicator 3: Composition of Core Funds (“CCF”)

4.11 The CCF incentives DTMs that maintain a stable liability structure, which will minimize
the probability of bank-run during stress period that will erode franchise value of the
institution, thus increasing the probability of PIDM to recover cost in resolution.

4.12 The formula to calculate the CCF is as follows:

```
Total Core Funds
X 100%
Total Available Funds
```
```
Notes:
```
```
(a) Total core funds is the sum of the following deposits/borrowings:
(i) Retail deposits;
(ii) Small business customers;
(iii) Operational deposits;
(iv) Non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral
development banks (“MDBs”) and public sector entities (“PSEs”), with the
remaining maturity of more than one (1) year;
(v) Recourse obligation on loans and financing sold to Cagamas;
(vi) All debt instruments such as subordinated debts,
debts/certificates/Sukuk issued, commercial papers, structured notes or
products with the remaining maturity of more than one (1) year. For
clarity, the computation of debt instruments includes Tier 2 capital
```

```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
```
instruments and excludes AT1 capital instruments reported as financial
liabilities^7 ; and
(vii) Other borrowings in the form of term loans or syndicated loans, with the
remaining maturity of more than one (1) year.
```
```
(b) Total available funds: Sum of deposits from customers, deposits and
placements of banks and other financial institutions (including interbank
borrowings), recourse obligation on loans and financing sold to Cagamas, Repo,
all debt instruments (excluding AT1 capital instruments reported as financial
liabilities) and other borrowings.
```
```
A DTM’s CCF shall be scored based on the following threshold:
```
```

```
```
Threshold Score
```
```
Composition of core funds ≥ 50% 100 %
0% ≤ Composition of core funds < 50% Interpolated*
```
```
*The detailed explanation of linear interpolation method is provided under Paragraph 5.
```
### 5.0 LINEAR INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR RCC INDICATOR SCORE

5.1 The score for the RCC indicator within the applicable threshold is determined via a
linear interpolation method based on the upper and lower range of the threshold,
based on the DTM’s result for the respective indicators. A DTM with an RCC indicator
that meets or exceeds the upper threshold would obtain a score of 100%. Conversely,
if the RCC indicator is at or falls below the lower threshold, the DTM would not obtain
any score.

5.2 The score of interpolated shall be computed using the following linear interpolation
formula:

##### A – B

```
x 100%
C – B
```
(^7) The CCF computation excludes AT1 capital instruments from both the numerator and denominator, given its
feature for loss absorption on a going concern basis.


```
TITLE Guidance Note on Transition Period Reporting Under tDifferential Premium Systems Framework he^ Revised
```
```
Where,
A is the result of the DTM for the relevant indicator;
```
```
B is the minimum result attainable for the relevant indicator; and
```
```
C is the maximum result attainable for the relevant indicator.
```
5.3 An example of a DTM’s score for an RCC indicator based on the linear interpolation
method is outlined below:

```
Illustration 1: Computation of DTM’s score for FTAC ratio based on linear
interpolation method
```
```
The threshold and the corresponding scores for the FTAC ratio are as follows:
```
```
Threshold Score (%)
FTAC ratio ≥ 1.3 times 100
1 time < FTAC ratio < 1.3 times Interpolated
FTAC ratio ≤ 1 time 0
```
```
The table below sets out the FTAC ratio and corresponding scores for four (4)
hypothetical DTMs. The score for DTM C is determined based on the linear
interpolation method, as the ratio falls within the applicable threshold.
```
```
DTM FTAC Ratio Score Remarks
```
```
DTM A 0.84 0% DTM accorded zero score as the ratio falls below the lowest threshold point
```
```
DTM B 1.00 0% DTM accorded zero score as the ratio falls below the lowest threshold point
```
```
DTM C 1.22 73.33% The score is determined based on the linear interpolation method

```
## PART 3: SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION UNDER RCC ASSESSMENT

### 7.0 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Unless otherwise specified, all quantitative information shall be obtained from the
DTM’s financial statements as at 31 December of the preceding assessment year. The
financial statements shall mean the following:

```
(a) for a DTM with 31 December financial year end: its annual financial statement;
(b) for a DTM with non-31 December financial year end: its interim financial
statements; or
(c) for a DTM with non-31 December financial year end and the interim reporting
period does not end in December: its management accounts.
```
7.2 The source of information for all quantitative information in the DPS Transition Period
Reporting forms is detailed out in paragraph 8.

7.3 All DTMs must use the pre-formatted DPS Transition Period Reporting forms provided
by PIDM for the RCC indicators submission. A DTM must also ensure that no alteration
or amendment is made to these reporting forms.

7.4 All indicators and scores shall be expressed to two (2) decimal points.
