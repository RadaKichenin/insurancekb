###### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

#### BACKGROUND

1.1 The resolution planning initiative forms part of the broader BNM-PIDM joint
framework to implement recovery and resolution planning (“RRP”) for financial
institutions in Malaysia, whereby BNM leads the recovery planning and PIDM leads
the resolution planning. The RRP framework seeks to put in place an effective and
efficient process to enhance supervisability, recoverability and resolvability of these
financial institutions. The preparatory efforts undertaken during recovery and
resolution planning will also contribute to building a stronger and more resilient
financial system.

1.2 Recovery planning and resolution planning are two separate, but inter-related
processes. The recovery plan, prepared and maintained by a financial institution under
the supervision of BNM, aims to restore the long-term viability of the financial
institution and return it to business-as-usual when it comes under severe stress. For
detailed elaboration on recovery planning, please refer to BNM’s RCP Policy
Document.

1.3 In the event the financial institution’s recovery options are no longer feasible in
restoring its long-term viability, the focus would then switch to achieving a prompt
and orderly resolution of the non-viable financial institution. PIDM is mandated under
the PIDM Act to act as a resolution authority for its DTMs and to promote or contribute
to the stability of the Malaysian financial system.

1.4 Resolution involves the use of PIDM’s powers to manage the failure of its DTMs. As
the resolution authority, PIDM seeks to ensure that prompt and effective actions will
be taken to resolve the failure of the DTM in a least disruptive manner that minimises
costs to the financial system, and ensure that financial system stability is preserved.
This is commonly referred to as an orderly resolution. Please refer to **Appendix A** for
details of PIDM’s resolution objectives and strategies.

1.5 Given the need for a prompt implementation of resolution coupled with the unknown
nature and timing of future shocks, there is a much greater emphasis for preparation
and flexibility in resolution. In this regard, resolution planning, which is an advance
planning tool, enables PIDM to work with the DTM during business-as-usual to


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
develop a feasible and credible resolution plan that is customised for each DTM to
facilitate a prompt and orderly resolution in the event of the failure of a DTM. The
preparation during the resolution planning process provides optionality and flexibility
to facilitate swifter decision making, which is essential during a crisis.
```
1.6 As part of resolution planning, DTMs are expected to develop the necessary
capabilities to support the implementation of an orderly resolution in the event it
becomes non-viable. Synergies will be created through the integration of these
capabilities into the day-to-day processes and operations of the DTM. These synergies
may include enhanced governance, improved operational efficiency as well as better
risk management and monitoring.

1.7 Moving forward, PIDM intends to incorporate resolvability elements into its
Differential Premium Systems Framework (“DPS Framework”) as part of PIDM’s
strategic objective to provide incentives to DTMs to become more resolvable.

1.8 The RSP Guidelines set out PIDM’s approach to resolution planning and the
requirements applicable to DTMs.

1.9 The RSP Guidelines are structured as follows:

```

```
#### LEGAL PROVISIONS

1.10 Pursuant to section 97A of the PIDM Act, PIDM may draw up, review and amend a
resolution plan for the orderly resolution of a member institution.

1.11 Section 202 of the PIDM Act provides that for the purpose of exercising any of its
powers, performing any of its functions or discharging any of its duties, PIDM may
require information from a member institution or its related corporation on any
matter relating to the business or affairs of such member institution or related
corporation.

1.12 A reference to a statute or other law includes regulations and other instruments under
it and consolidations, amendments, re-enactments or replacements of any of them.

#### SCOPE AND APPLICATION

1.13 The RSP Guidelines are applicable to all DTMs.

1.14 The RSP Guidelines will come into effect on 8 September 2023. Resolution planning
will be implemented in phases, in line with the implementation of recovery planning
by BNM. PIDM will inform DTMs in writing on the implementation details of resolution
planning, including engagement timelines to give DTMs adequate time to prepare and
engage with PIDM.

1.15 Unless expressly stated otherwise, any information or document required to be
submitted to PIDM under the RSP Guidelines, including any letter, report, form,
returns and action plan, shall be submitted online through PIDM’s Industry Portal. The
hard copy of the above documents do not need to be submitted to PIDM, unless
required by PIDM.

1.16 PIDM may, in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as PIDM thinks fit,
specify such other periods or dates for any acts or things to be done under the RSP
Guidelines.

## SECTION 2: INTRODUCTION TO PIDM’S APPROACH TO RESOLUTION PLANNING

#### OVERVIEW

2.1 The effectiveness of PIDM’s powers in delivering an orderly resolution will depend on
the level of planning done ahead of stress emerging, in particular for cases involving
large and complex DTMs. In this regard, PIDM needs to work closely with DTMs to
develop a feasible and credible resolution plan during business-as-usual.

2.2 By design, resolution planning is a sequential progression following BNM’s recovery
planning, leveraging on information from the DTM’s recovery plan. Taking that into
account, PIDM’s resolution planning process is designed in three ( 3 ) stages as depicted
in the diagram below.

#### SCHEMATIC VIEW OF PIDM’S RESOLUTION PLANNING PROCESS


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
2.3 The key features of PIDM’s approach to resolution planning are as follows:

```
(a) Stage 1 – Validate PRS: PIDM’s preference is for all non-viable DTMs to be
resolved through a transfer strategy (the primary PRS). As a starting point, PIDM
shall leverage on the information submitted by the DTM under recovery
planning to validate its primary PRS and/or to set an alternate resolution
strategy (referred to as alternate PRS), where applicable. Where necessary,
PIDM may ask for additional information from the DTM;
```
```
(b) Stage 2 – Conduct Resolvability Assessment: As the DTM has the most in-depth
knowledge of its own business, the DTM carries out the feasibility assessment of
its PRS(s) and in consultation with PIDM, takes measures to improve its
resolvability. The feasibility assessment under resolution planning is intended as
a follow through and to complement the feasibility assessment carried out on
the DTM’s recovery options.^1 Some aspects of the feasibility assessment under
resolution planning may be a further extension of the DTM’s feasibility
assessment on its recovery options involving a sale or transfer, such as disposal
of branch/subsidiary or portfolios of assets. In this regard, where relevant, the
DTM may extend from their existing recovery options to put in place measures
and capabilities to support the effective implementation of the PRS in resolution.
Correspondingly, PIDM undertakes the credibility assessment and implements
measures to address industry-wide impediments, in consultation with BNM; and
```
```
(c) Stage 3 – Ensure Operational Readiness: PIDM develops the operational plan
based on the outcome of the resolvability assessment and tests the resolution
plan, supported by the DTM. PIDM expects resolution planning to be a
continuous process, where the DTM has a continued obligation to play a part to
build resilience and improve its resolvability over time.
```

```
#### COMMUNICATION DURING RESOLUTION PLANNING

2.4 Communication and close engagement between PIDM and the DTMs are key to the
success of resolution planning. Some of the key communication that can be expected
from PIDM during the resolution planning process are as follows:

```
(a) PIDM shall inform the DTM by way of written communication on the
implementation details of resolution planning;
```
```
(b) PIDM shall communicate the outcome of Stage 1, including the validated PRS(s),
to the DTM. The DTM may provide feedback on the PRS(s) for PIDM’s
consideration; and
```
```
(c) PIDM shall communicate formally with the Board of the DTM by way of a letter
on the progress and issues (if any) related to the resolution planning process on
an annual basis or as and when required (referred to as the “Resolution
Readiness Letter”). Matters highlighted in the Resolution Readiness Letter
should be tabled at the DTM’s next Board meeting. The Board of the DTM is
required to ensure that the DTM responds in writing to the matters highlighted
in PIDM’s Resolution Readiness Letter within three (3) months from the date of
the letter or any other timeline as may be stated in the aforementioned letter.
In responding to the Resolution Readiness Letter, the DTM is expected to
provide amongst others, details/progress of the measures or actions taken or
planned to be taken, including the related timelines. Where applicable, a
detailed remediation action plan to address the related impediments to
resolution may be required to form part of the DTM’s response.
```

```

```
###### SECTION 3: PIDM’S RESOLUTION PLANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPOSIT-TAKING

###### MEMBERS

3.1 A DTM shall support the resolution planning process as described in **Appendix B** , in
the manner and within the timeframe as specified by PIDM, as follows:^2

```
(a) Providing information and support in resolution planning: prepare and submit
the information as described in paragraph 3 .2 in the form and manner and
within such timeframe as required by PIDM. The resolution plan will be
developed on the basis that the DTM will be the resolution entity. The
information to be provided may be related to the DTM and/or its related
corporations (e.g. parent/holding company, subsidiaries and sister companies^3 )
that are necessary for purpose of resolution planning;^4
```
```
(b) Applying sound governance arrangements: put in place sound and effective
governance process to facilitate the resolution planning process. Please refer to
paragraph 3 .3 for details;
```
```
(c) Undertaking feasibility assessment on the PRS(s) validated by PIDM :
```
```
(i) Identifying potential impediments that may hinder the prompt and
effective implementation of the resolution plan (also known as
“impediments to resolution”). The outcomes intended for feasibility
assessment are outlined in paragraph 3. 4. Further details on feasibility
assessment will be issued by PIDM in the resolvability assessment
framework, as appropriate;
```
```
(ii) Developing remediation action plan(s) to address identified impediments
to resolution by proposing measures and building the necessary capabilities
to address identified impediments to resolution. A DTM is expected to
provide PIDM with periodic updates on its action plans and progress in
remediating the impediments to resolution; and
```
2
The resolution planning requirements for DTMs set out in this section are not meant to be exhaustive and
PIDM may set out additional requirements as and when necessary and relevant.

(^3) Sister companies refer to subsidiaries of the DTM’s parent/holding company.
(^4) For an Islamic DTM which is a subsidiary or sister company of another DTM, the Islamic DTM may leverage on
information, assessment or resources of its parent/holding company or sister DTM, but the Islamic DTM will
need to ensure that the information submitted is coherent.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
(d) Maintaining capabilities required to support the implementation of the
resolution plan and supporting PIDM in conducting regular tests to ensure that
capabilities and resources are at a level of readiness to effectively implement
the plan. The capabilities include, but is not limited to, ensuring arrangements
have been put in place to secure the continuity of operational, financial, legal
and business interdependencies, data and systems capabilities as well as
maintaining required resources to implement the resolution plan (as necessary).
PIDM will guide DTMs in building and maintaining the necessary capabilities, as
part of the resolution planning process.
```
3.2 Information requirements and support

```
3.2.1 A DTM shall support PIDM in the development and implementation of a
resolution plan. This may include, but is not limited to:
```
```
(a) providing additional information and clarification on the DTM’s recovery
plan, particularly the strategic analysis section, to support the
validation/setting of the DTM’s PRS(s);
```
```
(b) submitting the necessary information or assessment^5 on the DTM’s
resolution capabilities as part of the resolvability assessment, including
information required under paragraph 3.1(c) ; and
```
```
(c) submitting the necessary information to support the development of the
operational plan, which forms part of the resolution plan, to articulate
how the PRS(s) will be implemented.
```
3.3 Governance requirements

```
3.3.1 Role of the Board: The Board of the DTM is responsible for ensuring the
necessary capabilities are in place for the DTM to be resolved in an orderly
manner, in line with the resolvability expectations and requirements of PIDM.
The Board shall ensure that there are clear roles and responsibilities at the
senior management level for the purpose of meeting the requirements in this
RSP Guidelines, including the designation of senior officer(s) or an internal
```
5
Information requirements by PIDM on the DTM will be tailored and targeted, depending on the specificities
of the DTM such as its size, complexities, business profiles, operational dependencies, and structures.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
governing body^6 to be responsible for resolution planning matters. The Board
is also required to ensure that the DTM responds to PIDM’s Resolution
Readiness Letter as described in paragraph 2. 4 (c) above. The Board shall
oversee and approve, where applicable, the feasibility assessment and the
remediation action plan as described in paragraph 3..
```
```
3.3.2 Role of senior officer(s)/internal governing body designated to be
responsible for resolution planning: The designated senior officer(s) or
internal governing body is responsible to provide the necessary support to the
Board throughout the resolution planning process. Some of its responsibilities
include:
```
```
(a) ensuring the accuracy of information and data submitted;
```
```
(b) allocating adequate and dedicated resources to undertake resolution
planning;
```
```
(c) undertaking feasibility assessment and development of remediation
action plan;
```
```
(d) updating the Board regularly on the progress and issues in resolution
planning (including the matters highlighted in the Resolution Readiness
Letter and the corresponding response to PIDM); and
```
```
(e) notifying PIDM of any circumstances that may materially affect the
DTM’s resolution plan.
```
```
3.3.3 Role of Shariah Committee: The Shariah Committee is responsible to advise
on the application of Shariah requirements, where applicable, during the
resolution planning process.
```
```
Details of the governance requirements can be found in Appendix C.
```
(^6) The Board may leverage on the DTM’s existing management or Board committees or establish dedicated
resources to perform the role. Given the close inter-linkages between recovery planning and resolution
planning, where practicable, it may be advantageous for the DTM to have cross membership of the recovery
planning and resolution planning teams to ensure efficiency and continuity.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
3.4 Feasibility assessment and remediation action plan(s)

```
3.4.1 DTMs are required to conduct a feasibility assessment to evaluate the
implementation readiness of their respective PRS(s). The feasibility assessment
shall be conducted by personnel with the appropriate skills and experience.
The intended outcomes include amongst others:
```
```
(a) identifying any potential impediments to resolution that may hinder the
effective implementation of the PRS(s) (e.g. IT system, contractual
arrangements, structural or operational barriers);
```
```
(b) proposing, developing and implementing remediation action plans to
address the impediments to resolution; and
```
```
(c) building the necessary capabilities to support the implementation of the
resolution plan and demonstrating to PIDM that the DTMs meet the
resolvability expectations determined by PIDM.
```
```
PIDM will guide DTMs in the feasibility assessment by setting out the related
resolvability expectations for purpose of building the necessary capabilities in
achieving these outcomes to support an effective resolution. The broad resolvability
expectations are set out in paragraph 5. 17 of Appendix B.
```
```
3.4.2 PIDM may require an independent review^7 of the feasibility assessment
conducted by the DTM, if necessary. For example, the independent review may
be required where a DTM has consistently neglected or failed to rectify
significant information gaps in its feasibility assessment despite being given
various opportunities to do so. The scope of the independent review will vary
on a case-by-case basis. The results of the independent review shall be
addressed to PIDM and tabled to the DTM’s Board for further action.
```
3.5 **Significant overseas presence** : A DTM with significant overseas presence shall support
the development and maintenance of the cross-border components of the resolution
plan. For example, a DTM may be involved in identifying and addressing impediments
relating to any material financial and/or operational dependencies between the DTM
and its foreign subsidiaries or related corporations to ensure that the DTM’s resolution
plan can be implemented promptly and effectively.

(^7) The independent review may either be undertaken by the internal audit function of the DTM or an external
party who is qualified and competent to conduct such review at the DTM’s own costs.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
3.6 **Alignment with foreign parent group’s resolution plan** : Similar to other DTMs, the
resolution plan for a locally incorporated foreign DTM is a local plan involving a
transfer strategy as the primary PRS. This is intended to maintain continuity of critical
functions and services, minimise disruption to the financial system and help preserve
the franchise value of the DTM. The development of the local resolution plan will
consider the foreign parent group’s resolution plan, if applicable. Where relevant,
PIDM and BNM will participate in crisis management groups (“CMGs”) or resolution
colleges of DTMs’ foreign parent banks to discuss cross-border issues and expectations
in resolution planning, with the intent to facilitate cross-border cooperation and
coordination in crisis management and resolution, concerning the locally incorporated
foreign DTM.

3.7 **Notification and disclosure** : A DTM must notify PIDM promptly if it becomes aware of
any change to its business and structure that would create a material barrier or
impediment to the implementation of its resolution plan (e.g. a disposal or acquisition
of a substantial business undertaking, material restructuring or change in business
arrangements). Information arising from resolution planning, including but not limited
to information that may pose a risk to or potentially affect public confidence in the
DTM and/or the broader financial system, is to be kept confidential and shall not be
disclosed.

###### SUMMARY OF KEY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DTM AND PIDM IN

###### RESOLUTION PLANNING

Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia
8 September 2023


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
## APPENDIX A: DELIVERING AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION

#### RESOLUTION OBJECTIVES

4.1 PIDM is the resolution authority for its DTMs. In carrying out the resolution of its
DTMs, PIDM shall have regard to the following resolution objectives, and will develop
a resolution strategy that is assessed to be most suited to achieve the objectives:

```
(a) promote or contribute to the stability of the Malaysian financial system,
including continuing the performance of critical functions;
(b) maintain public and market confidence;
(c) minimise cost^8 and disruption to the financial system;
(d) protect against loss of deposits covered by PIDM; and
(e) minimise loss to public funds.
```
```
The above objectives are not ranked in any particular order, and will be assessed
collectively.
```
#### RESOLUTION POWERS AND STRATEGIES

4.2 The PIDM Act empowers PIDM with a wide range of powers^9 to facilitate the effective
and orderly resolution of a DTM. PIDM may use these powers individually or
collectively. The resolution strategies can be broadly categorised into going-concern
and gone-concern approach.

4.3 The primary aim of the going-concern approach is to ensure critical functions
performed by the non-viable DTM are continued so as to minimise disruptions and
impact to the financial system and economy. Strategies under the **going-concern
approach** include:

```
(a) Transfer strategy:
```
```
(i) Transfer to a private sector purchaser : PIDM has the power to transfer all
or part of the assets and liabilities, businesses and affairs or shares of the
```
(^8) Takes into consideration the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the cost.
(^9) In executing the resolution strategies for Islamic DTMs, PIDM shall take into consideration Shariah
requirements.^


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
non-viable DTM to a private sector acquirer.^10 This is the preferred option
as it allows customers and depositors to have continued access to financial
services, and the responsibility for continuing the business remains in the
private sector;
```
```
(ii) Transfer to a bridge institution: When there is no viable private sector
solution at the point of resolution, bridge institution may be implemented
as a stabilisation tool. A bridge institution is a subsidiary of PIDM designated
under the PIDM Act to assume all or part of the assets and liabilities,
businesses and affairs of a non-viable DTM, to ensure continuity of critical
functions and services with the aim of effecting an onward sale to a private
sector purchaser at a later time; and
```
```
(iii) Transfer to an asset management company: PIDM may transfer distressed
or non-performing assets of the DTM to an asset management company
("AMC"). The AMC refers to a company that acquires the DTM's distressed
assets. The AMC could either be a subsidiary of PIDM or a private sector
entity. The aim is to allow for these assets to be carved out and managed
separately, thereby enabling the DTM to carry on its remaining businesses
more efficiently. The AMC manages these assets with a view to maximise
the value through an eventual sale or orderly wind-down.
```
```
(b) Restructuring: PIDM may restructure the balance sheet, businesses and/or
operations of the DTM in order to address the causes of its failure and ensure
that the DTM’s business, operational or financial viability can be restored or
revived to continue as a going-concern post restructuring.
```
4.4 Under the **gone-concern approach** , the primary aim is to ensure a prompt and orderly
dissolution of the DTM and protection of insured deposits. This will be achieved via:

```
(a) Winding up of the DTM: PIDM may petition to wind up and liquidate a non-
viable DTM and will promptly reimburse the insured deposits to the depositors
of that DTM. The appointed liquidator will then liquidate the non-viable DTM’s
business and assets. Proceeds from the disposal of assets are then paid to the
DTM’s creditors in accordance with their hierarchy of claims in liquidation.
```
(^10) The private sector acquirer is subjected to the shareholder suitability criteria under BNM’s Financial Services
Act 2013 or Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 and BNM’s policy document on Shareholder Suitability.

## APPENDIX B: PIDM’S APPROACH TO RESOLUTION PLANNING

#### GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO RESOLUTION PLANNING

5.1 Resolution involves the use of PIDM’s powers to manage the failure of its DTMs. The
effectiveness of PIDM’s powers in delivering an orderly resolution will depend on the
level of planning done ahead of stress emerging. Planning for resolution well ahead of
any stress emerging reduces the risk and impact of a disorderly failure. PIDM is guided
by the following principles in its design and implementation of resolution planning:

```
(a) Minimising duplication: As a starting point of the resolution planning process,
PIDM shall leverage on the DTM’s recovery plan, specifically the strategic
analysis section, to validate the primary PRS and set the alternate PRS for the
DTM. This approach is intended to minimise unnecessary duplication and reduce
the reporting burden on the DTM;
```
```
(b) Proportionality principle: PIDM will take into consideration the specificities of
each DTM (e.g. business profiles, size and complexities) when applying its
resolution planning requirements, but without undermining the end goal of
resolvability. PIDM will tailor the level of details and extent of information
required as well as the measures to address impediments to resolution to
commensurate with the DTM’s specificities. The frequency and intensity of the
resolution planning work is expected to reduce accordingly, once the DTM has
substantially met the resolvability expectations; and
```
```
(c) Consultative approach: Given that each DTM possesses in-depth knowledge and
understanding of its own businesses and operations, it is imperative for PIDM to
work closely with the DTM in the development of the resolution plan. PIDM
expects to engage the DTM by way of regular discussions or dialogues in
workshops, checkpoint meetings or other forms of engagements throughout the
resolution planning process.

#### RESOLUTION PLANNING PROCESS

5.2 PIDM’s resolution planning process is designed in three ( 3 ) stages as depicted in the
diagram below.

**SCHEMATIC VIEW OF PIDM’S RESOLUTION PLANNING PROCESS**

##### Stage 1: Validate Preferred Resolution Strategy

5.3 PIDM will leverage on information obtained from the DTM’s recovery plan to validate
the primary PRS for the DTM and set an alternate PRS, where applicable. Where
necessary, PIDM may ask for additional information or seek clarification from the
DTM.^11

(^11) PIDM may coordinate with BNM in obtaining clarification or additional information relating to the recovery
plan to minimise unnecessary duplication and reduce the reporting burden on the DTM.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
5.4 The failure and closure of a DTM may cause disruptions to the DTM’s customers,
financial counterparties and/or the broader financial markets and systems. In order to
minimise such disruptions, PIDM’s preference is for all non-viable DTMs to be resolved
through a transfer strategy (i.e. transfer of shares, businesses and/or portfolio of
assets and liabilities to either a private sector purchaser or a bridge institution). A
transfer strategy ensures the continuity of critical functions, minimises disruptions
and facilitates better preservation of the franchise value of the DTM. In this respect,
as part of resolution planning, the primary PRS for all DTMs will be the transfer
strategy.

5.5 PIDM expects all DTMs to be “transfer-ready”. In order to be transfer-ready, a DTM
should possess the capabilities to support PIDM in executing a prompt and effective
transfer during a resolution. For example:

```
(a) the ability to generate sufficient and accurate information in a timely manner
for the valuation of its businesses, assets, liabilities or a combination thereof;
and
```
```
(b) the availability of adequate arrangements (including contractual) to support a
transfer in resolution to ensure continuity of services.
```
```
Further details on the capabilities necessary to support a transfer in resolution will be
issued by PIDM in the resolvability assessment framework.
```
5.6 However, the feasibility of any PRS could be impacted by other factors beyond PIDM’s
control (e.g. no suitable purchaser at the point of resolution). Hence, PIDM may
require a DTM to be prepared for an alternate PRS.

5.7 The identification of an alternate PRS by PIDM will take into account the specificities
of each DTM such as the scale and complexity of the DTM’s business. For example, for
smaller DTMs with simpler and less complex structure, the alternate PRS may involve
a prompt and orderly winding up of the DTM.

5.8 The PRS is a presumptive path for planning purposes. There may be circumstances or
situations at the time of resolution that necessitate a different resolution strategy
(individually or in combination) to be implemented by PIDM, instead of the planned
strategy (PRS or alternate PRS).


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
5.9 PIDM shall communicate the outcome of Stage 1 of the resolution planning process,
including the PRS(s), to the DTM. As part of the consultative approach, the DTM may
provide feedback for PIDM’s consideration. This will not, however, be binding on
PIDM. PIDM will ultimately determine the PRS(s) for the DTM.

##### Stage 2: Conduct Resolvability Assessment

5.10 Once the PRS(s) has been validated/set, PIDM will work together with the DTM to
assess the feasibility and credibility of its PRS(s) through a process called resolvability
assessment. To be resolvable, the DTM should be organised and operate in a way that
will not materially impede the execution of its PRS(s). PIDM expects that the priority
and focus of the resolvability assessment will be on the primary PRS, followed by the
alternate PRS, as appropriate.

5.11 The resolvability assessment comprises two (2) components:

```
(a) Feasibility assessment (to be undertaken by the DTM) – to assess whether the
PRS(s) can be executed effectively within the relevant legal framework(s) and
within an appropriate timeframe with no major impediments. Further details on
the feasibility assessment are described in paragraphs 5. 14 to 5. 17 below; and
```
```
(b) Credibility assessment (to be undertaken by PIDM) – to assess whether the
execution of the PRS(s) will give rise to significant adverse consequences to the
financial system and the real economy. As part of this assessment, PIDM may
conduct a horizontal assessment of industry-wide impediments, in consultation
with BNM.
```
5.12 The resolvability assessment is expected to be undertaken in phases over several
years, depending on the extent of the impediments identified and the speed in which
a DTM addresses the related impediments, including developing the related
capabilities to support the implementation of the resolution plan.

5.13 Resolvability is best understood as a spectrum of varying degrees, not a binary
judgement. Therefore, PIDM will identify and set out the expected outcomes in order
for DTMs to be considered resolvable (referred to as resolvability expectations). The
level and extent of work required to build the necessary capabilities may differ across
DTMs depending on their size and complexities, in line with the principle of
proportionality. Further details on resolvability expectations are described in
**paragraph 5.1 7** below.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
Feasibility assessment
```
5.14 Feasibility assessment involves, amongst others, the following:

```
(a) identifying any potential impediments to resolution that may hinder the
effective implementation of the PRS(s) (e.g. IT system, contractual
arrangements, structural or operational barriers);
```
```
(b) proposing, developing and implementing remediation action plans to address
any impediments to resolution; and
```
```
(c) building the necessary capabilities to support the implementation of the
resolution plan and demonstrating to PIDM that the DTM meets the resolvability
expectations determined by PIDM.
```
5.15 The feasibility assessment under resolution planning is intended as a follow through
and to complement the feasibility assessment on recovery options.^12 For example, the
feasibility assessment on transferability under resolution planning is an extension of
the feasibility assessment of recovery options involving a sale or transfer. The
assessment under resolution planning as guided by our resolvability expectations, may
cover more extensive areas such as management information system (“MIS”)
capabilities in generating timely and accurate information as well as the robustness of
the DTM’s contractual arrangements to support a prompt and effective transfer in
resolution.

5.16 The extent of feasibility assessment is not standardised across all DTMs, but is
intended to be proportionate to the size and complexity of the DTM and tailored to
its PRS(s). Hence, for smaller and less complex DTMs, their feasibility assessment is
expected to be less extensive.

5.17 PIDM will guide DTMs in the feasibility assessment by setting out the related
resolvability expectations for purpose of building the necessary capabilities to support
an effective resolution. The resolvability expectations are broadly categorised into the
following areas:

```
(a) continuity in resolution;^13
(b) data, MIS and valuation;
```
(^12) Feasibility assessment on recovery options refers to the requirements under BNM’s RCP Policy Document.
(^13) Continuity in resolution refers to continuity of operational, financial, legal and business interdependencies.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
(c) liquidity and funding in resolution;
(d) access to financial market infrastructures;
(e) communication in resolution; and
(f) governance in resolution.
```
```
Further details on feasibility assessment and resolvability expectations will be issued
by PIDM in the resolvability assessment framework.
```
```
Information provision
```
5.18 For the purpose of feasibility assessment, the DTM is expected to submit information
in the manner and within the timeframe as communicated by PIDM.^14

5.19 In addition, PIDM may also leverage on the DTM’s existing submissions, for example,
information as required under PIDM’s Guidelines on Deposit Information Systems and
Submission, for the development of the resolution plan, where applicable.

```
Remediation action plan(s) to address impediments
```
5.20 Based on the impediments identified during the feasibility assessment process, the
DTM (in consultation with PIDM) is then required to develop remediation action
plan(s) which sets out the measures to remediate these impediments and the
expected timelines. PIDM will review the DTM’s remediation action plan(s) and where
required, the DTM must provide additional information or assessment to facilitate the
review.

5.21 As for the impediments identified under the credibility assessment process, PIDM shall
work with BNM and any other relevant authorities to address the impediments, which
may involve policy, structural or industry-wide impediments.

```
Resolution Readiness Letter
```
5.22 In addition to the regular discussions and communication at the working levels, PIDM
intends to communicate formally with the Board of the DTM by way of a letter on the
progress and issues (if any) related to the resolution planning process on an annual
basis or as and when required (referred to as the “Resolution Readiness Letter”).
Matters highlighted in the Resolution Readiness Letter should be tabled at the DTM’s
next Board meeting. The Board of the DTM is required to ensure that the DTM reviews,

(^14) For efficiency and efficacy, communications between PIDM and DTMs may be in verbal form during
meetings, workshops or conference calls, or in written form such as by emails or letters.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
considers and responds to the matters highlighted in PIDM’s Resolution Readiness
Letter within three (3) months from the date of the letter or any other timeline as may
be stated in the aforementioned letter. In responding to the Resolution Readiness
Letter, the DTM is expected to provide amongst others, the details of the measures
and actions taken or planned to be taken, including the related timelines. Where
applicable, a detailed remediation action plan to address the related impediments to
resolution may be required to form part of the DTM’s response.
```
##### Stage 3: Ensure Operational Readiness

5.23 Based on the outcome of resolvability assessment, PIDM will develop an operational
plan specific to each DTM. The operational plan, which forms part of the resolution
plan, would set out, at minimum, the steps that a DTM must take to execute its PRS(s),
including implementation steps along with the estimated implementation timelines
and steps to remediate any impediments to ensure an orderly resolution. The DTM
may be required to provide additional information and inputs to support PIDM in the
development of the operational plan.

5.24 Testing is an integral part of ensuring that the resolution plan is current and relevant,
and can be executed effectively. In this regard, testing may be designed and
performed in parts or in phases, covering amongst others, key areas of the resolution
plan. Key objectives of the testing include the following:

```
(a) validate capabilities and the level of readiness to implement the resolution plan
and identify areas requiring further enhancement for continuous improvement;
and
```
```
(b) confirm the roles and responsibilities as well as the coordination arrangements
between key stakeholders, including PIDM, during resolution.
```
5.25 PIDM will work with the DTM to design and conduct testing exercises (which may be
in the form of simulations, dry-runs and/or fire drills) covering key legal, operational,
financial and governance aspects of its resolution plan.^15 Where appropriate, a DTM
may integrate these simulation programmes into its business-as-usual enterprise risk
management framework, policies and procedures to enhance risk management and
operational efficiency.

15
For avoidance of doubt, selective testings, simulations or fire drills can still be planned and conducted during
Stage 2 on certain key operational areas or functions (as appropriate) once it is assessed that the key
impediments to resolution have been substantially addressed and the resolvability expectations are met to
the level satisfactory to PIDM.


```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
5.26 PIDM may share key elements of the resolution plan with the DTM. The resolution
plan is a living-document to be updated and enhanced over time to reflect the
evolvement of the DTM’s business, operations and legal structure. Generally, a
resolution plan consists of the following key components:

```
(a) an overview of a DTM’s legal, operational, business and financial structures and
material dependencies;
```
```
(b) a description of the PRS that is customised to the DTM;
```
```
(c) findings from the resolvability assessment, including potential impediments to
resolution specific to the DTM and remediation measures or action plans to
address the identified impediments to resolution; and
```
```
(d) an operational plan that articulates and supports the implementation of the PRS.
```
5.27 The resolution plan will be developed on the basis that the DTM will be the resolution
entity. For avoidance of doubt, for a DTM with more complex group structure and
which is more integrated operationally and financially, resolution planning and
development of the resolution plan will take into consideration the DTM’s
parent/holding company, significant subsidiaries and sister companies (both local and
overseas) as well as any material intragroup dependencies.

5.28 After a DTM has substantially addressed the key impediments to resolution and met
the resolvability expectations to the level satisfactory to PIDM, resolution planning
work is expected to be reduced in terms of intensity and frequency. The resolution
plan will be continuously reviewed and refined to ensure that the plan is kept current
and relevant.

## APPENDIX C: GOVERNANCE EXPECTATIONS FOR RESOLUTION PLANNING

6.1 This section sets out the governance related expectations on the DTM throughout the
resolution planning stages reflected in this RSP Guidelines.

6.2 A DTM is required to put in place robust governance framework and arrangements to
support resolution planning which, at a minimum, should include:

```
(a) well-defined roles, responsibilities and accountability of the Board, senior
management, business units and control functions; and
```
```
(b) robust internal policies, procedures and MIS to support the required submission
of information, identification of impediments to resolution, and development of
remediation action plan(s) to address impediments. These documents are
required to be reviewed regularly by the DTMs to ensure that they remain
current, effective and relevant.
```
6.3 The DTM is expected to consider and incorporate resolution planning capabilities (i.e.
the necessary capabilities to support the implementation of the resolution plan) into
its existing risk management framework and governance arrangement, where
appropriate, as part of the DTM’s crisis preparedness.

6.4 The Board of a DTM shall provide effective oversight on all aspects of resolution
planning requirements involving the DTM. In doing so, the Board shall, at a minimum:

```
(a) designate senior officer(s) or an internal governing body (comprising personnel
with the necessary competencies and authority) to be responsible for resolution
planning submissions and requirements. The Board may leverage on the existing
management or Board committees or establish dedicated resources to perform
the role;^16
```
```
(b) provide constructive challenge to the conclusion, reasoning, and analysis
throughout the resolution planning process (e.g. the identified impediments to
```
(^16) Where the financial group comprises more than one (1) DTM, the financial group may have established
existing governance structure for purpose of recovery planning or other risk management planning that is
centralised at the group level. In this regard, the Board of a DTM may leverage on the existing arrangements,
including resources, for purpose of resolution planning. Nevertheless, the Board of a DTM will still be
responsible for the resolution planning of its DTM.

appropriately addressed in the corresponding response to PIDM;
```
```
(f) ensure that sufficient resources and appropriate representations across core
organisational functions are allocated to support the resolution planning
process, including the iterative process of planning and consultation with PIDM;
```
```
(g) ensure that robust arrangements are in place to ensure that the information
submitted to PIDM is timely and accurate; and
```
```
(h) promote understanding of, and involvement in, the resolution planning process,
at all relevant levels across the organisation.
```
6.5 The senior officer(s) or internal governing body of a DTM designated to be responsible
for resolution planning shall provide the necessary support to the Board of the DTM
throughout the resolution planning process. In addition to that, the senior officer(s) or
internal governing body shall, at a minimum:

```
(a) provide regular updates to the Board of the DTM on the issues, progress and
material developments relating to resolution planning (including the matters
highlighted in the Resolution Readiness Letter and the corresponding response
to PIDM);
```
```
(b) ensure the accuracy and integrity of the resolution planning related information
submitted to PIDM in any form as may be required;
```
```
(c) undertake feasibility assessment based on the DTM’s PRS, as well as identify and
propose measures to address impediments to resolution arising from the
feasibility assessment;
```

```
TITLE Guidelines on Resolution Planning for Deposit-Taking Members
```
```
(d) implement the measures identified to address impediments according to the
timeline agreed with PIDM, including building and maintaining the necessary
capabilities to ensure that the DTM can be resolved in an orderly manner;
```
```
(e) inform PIDM in a timely manner in the event any circumstances arise that may
materially affect the DTM’s resolution plan, for example in the event of any
significant changes to the business, structure or operations of the DTM;
```
```
(f) coordinate the resolution planning process to ensure that sufficient and relevant
resources across core organisational functions are involved throughout the
process, including the iterative process with PIDM; and
```
```
(g) ensure that well-defined processes and robust MIS are in place to provide timely
and accurate information for resolution planning on an ongoing basis and as and
when required by PIDM.
```
6.6 For resolution planning process involving a DTM carrying on Islamic banking business,
the DTM’s Shariah Committee shall, where relevant:

```
(a) advise on the application of Shariah requirements throughout the different
stages of resolution planning process, including during the identification of
impediments to resolution and the development of remediation action plan(s)
to remediate impediments to resolution;
```
```
(b) advise and provide clarifications on Shariah matters issued by BNM, and if
relevant, any other authorities, which may impact the development and
implementation of the DTM’s resolution plan; and
```
```
(c) provide opinions on any other Shariah matters in general.
```
6.7 As and when required, PIDM may request a DTM to submit its governance structure
for resolution planning processes, including details of the requirements provided
under paragraphs 6 .2 to 6.6 herein.
